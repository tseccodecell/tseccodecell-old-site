<h2>Weekly Challenges</h2>
<p class="bio">Weekly Challenges are an initiative to encourage regular practice. Each week we select three problems of varying difficulty from different competetive programming websites.</p>
</br>
<p class="bio"> We encourage you to find, implement and test various solutions to these. Feel free to Google concepts you don't know and discuss with your friends! At the end of the week, <em>please fill the feedback form provided </em> so we know what we can do better!</p>
